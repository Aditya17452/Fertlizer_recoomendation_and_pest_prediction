🌱 Sustainable Fertilizer Recommendation System
The Sustainable Fertilizer Recommendation System is an AI-powered project designed to help farmers make informed decisions about fertilizer usage based on soil health and crop requirements — without needing expensive hardware like sensors.

🚜 Problem It Solves
In India and many other agricultural economies, farmers often:

Overuse or misuse fertilizers, leading to poor soil health and reduced productivity.

Lack expert guidance tailored to their specific soil and crop types.

Have limited access to modern agri-tech solutions due to affordability or lack of digital infrastructure.

This system addresses those issues with a lightweight, user-friendly, and intelligent solution.

💡 What It Does
The system allows users (mainly farmers or agri-students) to:

Manually input key soil parameters:

pH Level

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) values

Crop Type

Based on this input, it provides:

Smart fertilizer recommendations

Quantities and types of nutrients needed

Eco-friendly suggestions where possible

Premium features like:

PDF download or WhatsApp sharing of the report

Buy links for recommended fertilizers

1-on-1 crop consultation (optional)

🧠 Tech Stack & Tools Used
Python (core logic + backend)

Flask (web framework)

Pandas (data handling)

Matplotlib (basic visualization)

HTML/CSS (frontend)

Razorpay or UPI (payment integration for premium reports)

GitHub (version control)

📈 Business Potential
